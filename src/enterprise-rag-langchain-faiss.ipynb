It addresses the shortcomings revealed during the financial crisis of 2007-09 by introducing measures that strengthen risk management, supervision, and governance practices. Key components include a non-risk based leverage ratio to contain excessive leverage, improved capital requirements for exposures to central counterparties and equity investments, and global liquidity standards such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to ensure banks maintain sufficient high-quality liquid assets and stable funding sources. Overall, Basel III seeks to promote a more robust financial system capable of withstanding economic shocks. \n","\n","Sources:\n","  • basel3_overview.txt.txt  (chunk 0)\n","  • basel3_overview.txt.txt  (chunk 3)\n","  • basel3_overview.txt.txt  (chunk 4)\n","  • fatf_recs_overview.txt.txt  (chunk 20)\n","  • fatf_recs_overview.txt.txt  (chunk 26)\n","\n","Q: What are the main objectives of PSD2 and their impact on banks?\n","\n","A: The main objectives of PSD2 are:\n","\n","1. **Integration and Efficiency**: To contribute to a more integrated and efficient European payments market.\n","2. **Leveling the Playing Field**: To further level the playing field for payment service providers by including new players.\n","3. **Safety and Security**: To make payments safer and more secure.\n","4. **Consumer Protection**: To enhance protection for European consumers and businesses.\n","\n","The impact of these objectives on banks includes:\n","\n","- **Increased Competition**: Banks face competition from new third-party payment service providers, which may lead to a need for banks to innovate and improve their services.\n","- **Regulatory Compliance**: Banks must comply with new rules regarding access to payment accounts and liability issues, which may require changes in their operational processes.\n","- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Banks are required to implement stronger customer authentication and security measures, which can increase operational costs but also enhance consumer trust.\n","- **Collaboration with Third Parties**: Banks may need to collaborate with third-party providers to offer integrated services, potentially leading to new business models and partnerships. \n","\n","Overall, PSD2 encourages banks to adapt to a more competitive and consumer-focused environment. \n","\n","Sources:\n","  • psd2_intro.txt.txt  (chunk 6)\n","  • psd2_intro.txt.txt  (chunk 7)\n","  • psd2_intro.txt.txt  (chunk 10)\n","  • psd2_intro.txt.txt  (chunk 12)\n","  • psd2_intro.txt.txt  (chunk 13)\n","\n","Q: Why do enterprises care about ISO 20022?\n","\n","A: Enterprises care about ISO 20022 for several reasons:\n","\n","1. **Modern Technology**: ISO 20022 uses mainstream XML technology, which is well-supported and facilitates efficient integration into existing systems.\n","\n","2. **Worldwide Adoption**: With nearly 200 market infrastructure initiatives implementing or considering ISO 20022, enterprises recognize the importance of aligning with a globally accepted standard.\n","\n","3. **Richer Data**: ISO 20022 enables the transmission of richer, better structured, and more granular data in payment messages, which enhances the quality of information exchanged.\n","\n","4. **Quality Payments**: Improved data quality leads to better transparency and remittance information, resulting in enhanced customer service and experience.\n","\n","5. **Operational Benefits**: The standard supports improved analytics, reduces manual intervention, enhances compliance processes, increases resilience, and strengthens fraud prevention measures.\n","\n","6. **End-to-End Automation**: ISO 20022 facilitates the creation of new services and enhances straight-through processing, supporting end-to-end automation of business processes.\n","\n","7. **Regulatory Compliance**: With the coexistence period for payment instructions ending on 22 November 2025, enterprises need to adopt ISO 20022 to remain compliant and competitive in the evolving payments landscape.\n","\n","Overall, adopting ISO 20022 is vital for enterprises to improve efficiency, enhance customer experience, and stay ahead in the financial services industry. \n","\n","Sources:\n","  • iso20022_about.txt.txt  (chunk 109)\n","  • iso20022_about.txt.txt  (chunk 108)\n","  • iso20022_about.txt.txt  (chunk 107)\n","  • psd2_intro.txt.txt  (chunk 6)\n","  • fatf_recs_overview.txt.txt  (chunk 57)\n"]}]}]}
